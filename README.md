# Tokyo Halal Tours

This repository contains a simple static website for **Tokyo Halal Tours**, a small business run by a husband and wife team living in Japan. The site introduces our halal-friendly tour service, highlights several tour packages, and provides a contact form for inquiries. Recent updates add a "Why Choose Us" section, an FAQ, social media links, and subtle animations for a more engaging experience. The project helps us establish a presence on TripAdvisor and showcase photos of Japan.
